This project takes on the theme of Football Players.

We take the players of each team in top flight football leagues (Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga), and store them in our database
One Person will take a league each, and their csv file will contain all of the players in that league, what manager they play under, what team they play for, etc.

A team must have many players and a player can have one team.
A player can be managed under one and only one manager and a manager can manage many players.


The Player database will store the player's first name, second name, shirt number, team they play for, age, and height (And transfer value??)
The Manager database will store the manager's first name, second name, team they manage, and age
The Team database will store the team's name, team abbreviation (e.g. Manchester United = MUN), team age (How long since it was founded), and team manager.
